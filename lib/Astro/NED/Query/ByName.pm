=head1 NAME

Astro::NED::Query::ByName - query NED by object name

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Astro::NED::Query::ByName;

  $req = Astro::NED::Query::ByName->new( Field => $value, ... );

  $req->Field( $value );

  $objs = $req->query;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class queries NED using the "Objects By Name" interface.  It
is a subclass of B<Astro::NED::Query>, and thus shares all of its
methods.

Class specific details are provided here.  See L<Astro::NED::Query>
for general information on the class methods (including those not
documented here) and how to set or get the search parameters.

=head2 Methods

=over

=item new

  $req = Astro::NED::Query::ByName->new( keyword1 => $value1,
				 keyword2 => $value2, ... );

Queries are constructed using the B<new> method, which is passed a
list of keyword and value pairs.  The keywords may be the names of
single valued query parameters, or may be class options.  There are no
options I<specific> to B<Astro::NED::Query::ByName>.

Search parameters may also be set or queried using the accessor methods;
see L<Astro::NED::Query>.


=item query

  $res = $req->query;

The B<query> method returns an instance of the
B<Astro::NED::Response::Objects> class, which contains the results of
the query.  At present it returns I<only> the summary table, not the
detailed information on each object.  See
L<Astro::NED::Response::Object> for more info.

If an error ocurred an exception is thrown via B<croak>.

=back

=head2 Search Parameters

Please note that for fields which take specific enumerated values, the
values are often I<not> those which are displayed by a web browser.
It's best to initially use the B<possible_values> method to determine
acceptable values.  Usually it's pretty obvious what they correspond
to.

The class accessor methods have the same names as the search parameters.
See L<Astro::NED::Query> on how to use them.

=over 8

=item ObjName

The object name.

=item Extend

Whether to perform an extended search.  Possible values are C<yes> and
C<no>.

=item CoordSys

The output coordinate system.  Use the B<possible_values> method
to determine which ones are available.

=item Equinox

The output coordinate system equinox.

=item Sort

The output sort order.   Use the B<possible_values> method
to determine which ones are available.

=item Format

Whether the output is formatted as an HTML table or plain text.
This will always be forced to HTML.

=item ListLimit

The upper limit to the number of objects with detailed information.
This is always set to force no detailed information

=item ZVBreaker

The maximum redshift velocity which will be displayed as km/s.

=item ImageStamp

Whether or not to return an image preview.  Always forced off.

=back

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
