	* NED output has added "Spectra" column which caused "RA" column to be
	  mismatched.

	* improved internal checks on column matching and added data
	  validity checks to (hopefully) prevent future silent errors
	  if NED output format changes.

	* new Response::Object::dumpstr method; dump method has added
	  parameter.

	* Astro::Ned::Query::reset and set_default methods are now
	  set_to_defaults and save_as_defaults.  The old method names are
	  now deprecated.
	
	* Astro::Ned::Query::set_to_defaults should actually do something now.
	
	* passing field values via the Astro::Ned::Query::XXX constructor
	  didn't work.
	
	* internal and test cleanups to modernize things and make
	  perlcritic --brutal happier
